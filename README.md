# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Module

## Description

This game module allows users to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a "learning" computer opponent. Rather than making purely random choices, the computer opponent employs a strategy: it frequently targets the player's most commonly defeated move, while occasionally adding in an element of randomness for unpredictability.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Experience a computer opponent that evolves its strategy based on player patterns.
- **Visual Feedback**: ASCII art representations for Rock, Paper, and Scissors to make the gameplay more engaging.
- **Interactive**: Colorful terminal outputs with the integration of the `colorama` module for better user experience.
